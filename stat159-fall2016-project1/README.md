This project describes useful computational tools for trying to create a reproducible project. The 
paper, found in the paper folder, is comprised of four sections (abstract, introduction, discussion, 
conclusion) which you can find in the sections subfolder. Images used in the paper can be 
found in the images folder. The Makefile contains the commands that automate the combination of 
sections and conversion from Markdown to HTML.
