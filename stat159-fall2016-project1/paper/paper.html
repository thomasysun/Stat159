<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Stat 159 emphasizes doing reproducible and collaborative data science. This paper is an effort to explain various tools that can be used to manage collaboration and promote reproducibility, as well as outline the steps necessary to utilize all of the tools. The introduction provides some background to Make, Makefiles, Git, and Github and highlights their role in creating a smooth, organized workflow in which others can easily track. Then, the discussion will go through the step-by-step process of creating the project, mentioning additional tools used and in what order. These include Markdown and Pandoc. Finally, the conclusion will go over overall thoughts on the process of creating the project, including challenges, difficulties, and solutions. This paper is created in hopes of serving as a guide on how to make future projects reproducible, and open to collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>There are various computational tools that can be used to streamline the process of writing an easily reproducible paper. One tool is called Make. Make is a software that automatically updates files in a project. Make specifically reads Makefiles, which specify which files need to be updated and changed. Makefiles are like a set of instructions for a more organized and automated workflow.</p>
<p>Another useful tool for reproducibility and collaboration is Git. Git is a version control program which let's you maintain multiple versions of a project at the same time. This lets others work separately and lets everyone track each others' changes. Git also lets you go back to old commit versions in case something needs to be revised.</p>

<p>GitHub is a website that provides the same capabilities as Git. Collaborators can check each other's Git repositories on GitHub and pull the most recent changes through Git.</p>

<p>Git and GitHub are both promote collaboration and openness in this way. Makefiles, Git, and GitHub were all used in this paper for version control and easy reproducibility.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p>Using Windows PowerShell, I created a folder for this project, which I then organized into various subfolders. All the files in the project folder were created through Powershell commands, except the images. In order to write the paper, I used a markup language called Markdown. Markdown has plain text formatting syntax which can be used to create rich text.</p>

<p>I used Notepad to write my markdown files. Each section of the paper has its own markdown file. I then created a Makefile with the section markdown files as the dependencies, so whenever I made a change in one of the sections, I could run make in PowerShell, which would run the commands to combine and update the end paper. In order to consolidate all the sections into one paper, I used Pandoc. Pandoc is a document converter than can convert files between various file types such as PDF, HTML, and MD. Pandoc was included as a command in the Makefile.</p>

<p>In this case, I used Pandoc to convert the MD files of each section into a single MD file, and ran Pandoc again to create an HTML file. I also created a README file in Markdown so others can understand the project. Whenever I made notable changes to any file in the project, I pushed my changes to the GitHub repository of the project so that others can view and pull the changes. I included a .gitignore file in case there are files in the project that I do not want Git to track.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Overall, the computational tools helped in various aspects of reproducibility and collaboration. Frequently pushing changes through Git allows myself and others to track updates and versions which can be easily accessed through the GitHub repository. Moreover, Make is particularly useful in consolidating changes. Combined with Pandoc, it made creating the final HTML file for the paper much simpler. However, arguably the most difficult part of the process was creating the Makefile. I ran into several issues, including one where the UNIX commands I was using were not recognized in PowerShell. It took several iterations of code before Make could properly read the script. I finally fixed my issues after collaborating with some classmates as well as getting help from the GSI.</p>
<p>Despite being relatively simple, writing the paper was the most time consuming portion of the project. In total, the project took about 6-8 hours to complete, including office hours and reading documentation about proper syntax for Pandoc, Markdown, Makefiles, etc.</p>
