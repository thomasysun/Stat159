## Abstract

Stat 159 emphasizes doing reproducible and collaborative data science. This paper is an 
effort to explain various tools that can be used to manage collaboration and promote 
reproducibility, as well as outline the steps necessary to utilize all of the tools. The 
introduction provides some background to Make, Makefiles, Git, and Github and highlights 
their role in creating a smooth, organized workflow in which others can easily track. Then,
the discussion will go through the step-by-step process of creating the project, mentioning 
additional tools used and in what order. These include Markdown and Pandoc. Finally, the 
conclusion will go over overall thoughts on the process of creating the project, including 
challenges, difficulties, and solutions. This paper is created in hopes of serving as a 
guide on how to make future projects reproducible, and open to collaboration.
