## Introduction

There are various computational tools that can be used to streamline the process of writing 
an easily reproducible paper. One tool is called Make. Make is a software that automatically 
updates files in a project. Make specifically reads Makefiles, which specify which files need to 
be updated and changed. Makefiles are like a set of instructions for a more organized and automated 
workflow. 

Another useful tool for reproducibility and collaboration is Git. Git is a version control 
program which let's you maintain multiple versions of a project at the same time. This lets others 
work separately and lets everyone track each others' changes. Git also lets you go back to old 
commit versions in case something needs to be revised.

GitHub is a website that provides the same capabilities as Git. Collaborators can check each other's 
Git repositories on GitHub and pull the most recent changes through Git.

Git and GitHub are both promote collaboration and openness in this way. Makefiles, Git, and GitHub
were all used in this paper for version control and easy reproducibility.
