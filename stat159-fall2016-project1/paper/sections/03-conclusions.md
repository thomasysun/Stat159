## Conclusions

Overall, the computational tools helped in various aspects of reproducibility and collaboration. 
Frequently pushing changes through Git allows myself and others to track updates and versions which 
can be easily accessed through the GitHub repository. Moreover, Make is particularly useful in 
consolidating changes. Combined with Pandoc, it made creating the final HTML file for the paper much 
simpler. However, arguably the most difficult part of the process was creating the Makefile. I ran 
into several issues, including one where the UNIX commands I was using were not recognized in PowerShell.
It took several iterations of code before Make could properly read the script. I finally fixed my issues
after collaborating with some classmates as well as getting help from the GSI. 

Despite being relatively simple, writing the paper was the most time consuming portion of the project. 
In total, the project took about 6-8 hours to complete, including office hours and reading documentation 
about proper syntax for Pandoc, Markdown, Makefiles, etc.
