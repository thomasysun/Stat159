Multiple Regression Analysis

This project reproduces the results shown in chapter 3 of ***An Introduction to Statistical Learning*** 
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, where they run a regression analysis 
on the *Advertising* data. The full report can be found in the "report" folder. The code, data, and 
images used for the report can be found in their respective folders.

To reproduce the analysis and report, run the files eda-script.R and regression-script.R, which generate 
regression statistics, tables on coefficients and correlations, and images. The fit and quality statistics were 
calculated using the functions created in regression-functions.R.
