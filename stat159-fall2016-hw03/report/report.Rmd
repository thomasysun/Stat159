```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
load(file="../data/correlation-matrix.RData")

kable(corr_matrix, digits = 3, caption = "Correlation Matrix")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
